# Other Flink and Apache Iceberg Examples


[flink-aws-dump.sql](flink-aws-dump.sql) uses a JDBC connection instead of CDC to perform a one time dump job

[flink-local.sql](flink-aws-dump.sql) uses a Generic hadoop catalog (which is ignored) and writes to a local file.

> TODO: update flink-local with a Minio based example
